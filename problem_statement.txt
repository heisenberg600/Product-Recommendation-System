# **Product Recommendation System - Technical Interview Task**

---

### **Objective**

Design and implement a recommendation engine that personalizes product suggestions based on user behavior and purchase history. The system should handle two distinct user segments with different recommendation strategies.

### **Problem Statement**

You have access to a dataset of approximately 75,000 products with associated pricing information. Your task is to architect and develop a recommendation system capable of identifying 5 relevant products for any given user, while accounting for different user personas and their behavioural patterns.

### **User Segments & Requirements**

**Segment 1: Loyal Customers**

- Users with established purchase history
- Recommendation strategy should leverage historical buying patterns
- Focus: Personalisation based on demonstrated preferences

**Segment 2: New Customers**

- Limited or no purchase history
- Requires alternative recommendation approach
- Consideration: Cluster users based on browsing/product similarity patterns
- Challenge: Generate meaningful recommendations despite sparse data

### **Deliverables**

1. **Methodology Document**
    - Approach for loyal customer recommendations
    - Approach for new customer recommendations (cold-start problem)
    - Justification for chosen algorithms and trade-offs
2. **REST API Implementation**
    - Endpoint to retrieve product recommendations for a user
    - Response should include:
        - 5 recommended products
        - Similarity/relevance score for each product
        - Confidence score indicating recommendation reliability
    - Proper error handling and edge case management
3. **Code Quality**
    - Production-ready backend architecture
    - Scalable and maintainable code structure
    - Clear separation of concerns

### **Evaluation Criteria**

You will be evaluated on the actual implementation of the solution as well as your overall project structure.

All the best!
